\section{Introduction}

VisLang is a block diagram language designed to allow fast and
easy prototyping of programs for embedded processors. The language is created
with a graphical editor in mind, and the core elements of the language are
extensible so that any graphical editor can add additional elements for
graphical display or other features.

\section{Key Language Features}

The language itself is based on the idea of blocks: small parts that can be grouped
together into ever larger blocks and re-used across a program or programs. A small
group of fundamental (or atomic) blocks will be defined and understood by the
compiler for this language. Other blocks will be constructed as configurations of
these atomic blocks. A standard library of useful functions will be constructed
from these atomic blocks containing common parts such as timers, latches, etc.

Side effects in the produced code will be minimized by the combination of a strong
type system and bounded code execution. The type system of VisLang supports common
datatypes such as bool, single, double, signed and unsigned integers, as well as
static arrays and structures of these simple datatypes. Bounded code execution is
guarenteed through the restriction of for loops to a static size. This works well
as embedded programs should only need to parse large buffers for digital busses,
which are usually defined as being a static size. The language will contain methods
for defining digital message structures and how to parse those structures into
usable variables. Methods for parsing both packet-based (e.g. Ethernet) and word-
based (e.g. RS232) will be provided by the standard library.

Lastly, time variance will be something provided fundamentally by the language.
The time-step between subsequent iterations will be maintained in every program
and provided to the user as a fundamental part. Most of the fundamental parts
will be time-invariant, but this language feature will provide users with the
ability to create dynamic parts that will care about time as a measured quantity.

\section{Syntax}

\section{Example Program}

Write a brief introduction in which you  outline the scope of your proposed
work. Use this space to explain why you are interested in this topic and what
you hope to learn. Connect your interest with what is currently known, and
include at least two references to related articles in the astronomical
literature.  You can use ADS  \url{http://adswww.harvard.edu/} and other links
on the class website \url{http://prancer.physics.louisville.edu/classes/308/} 
to help you find out more. An example citation is this paper
\cite{gonzalez2012}.

One to two pages should suffice for this part, but use more if you want.  
Include figures or images if needed.  Figure~\ref{m42} is an example of  how to
do it in \LaTeX.

of November 1, 2011. This is a composite of three 100-second photometric images
in the Sloan g' (shown as blue), r' (shown as red), and i' (shown as green)
bands. The intensities are displayed with logarithmic compression. Click to see
the inner regions with square root compression. Highly reddened stars are
brighter in the infrared (i') and appear slightly green in these images.

\section{Targets}

Identify the targets you want to study.  Define their observable characteristics
by giving their identifiers (e.g. common name if any, NGC or HD or other catalog
entry you can find with AstroCC and Simbad), celestial coordinates, optical
magnitudes, and angular size if the object is extended, that is, non-stellar.
Please select targets that we have a good likelihood of observing:
\begin{itemize}
\item Not fainter than magnitude 19 (18 is better)
\item Not larger than $0.5^\circ$, but see below
\item Above the horizon at either observatory for several hours this fall
\end{itemize}

A single 100 second exposure with the 0.5 meter telescopes will reach magnitude
18 on a clear night.  Accurate quantitative measurements require a little
brighter, or longer total accumulated exposures.  The telescopes resolve 1
arcsecond in two pixels and have a field of view of $0.6^\circ$.  Larger fields
must be mosaics of several exposures. These factors will affect your
choices.  

For planetary imaging the CDK20's can take exposures as short as 0.01 seconds. 
The longest practical single exposure is about 300 seconds, but typically we
take 100 second exposures and add them in order to make small guiding
corrections between exposures. Use AstroCC with Stellarium to assure that the
targets are observable this season.

\section{Filters, exposures, and special requests}

Assuming that the best telescope for your work is one of the two 0.5 meters
(CDK20N at Moore Observatory, CDK20S at Mt. Kent), you will have a choice of
filters:  Sloan filter set (g, r, i, or z),  Johnson-Cousins (U, B, V, R, or I),
color imaging (B, G, R, or clear), and narrow band (S $[II]$, red continuum,
H$\alpha$,  O$[III]$.  Identify which filters are of interest.

A typical exposure time for a magnitude 12 star to about half saturation is 100
seconds, but it depends on the filter choice.  Based on this, estimate how many
exposures you will need, and what total time you require.  In some cases, for
example studying an eclipsing or variable star, or an exoplanet transit, you
would use only one filter and make many measurements over a night.  In others,
you may make only a few exposures in each filter, and try many different
filters.   Changing filter sets takes an operator and several minutes, but
changing filters within one set (e.g. a different Sloan filter) takes only a few
seconds.

We have other telescopes that may be available at Moore Observatory this season.
There is a wide field astrograph that has a field of view of $4^\circ$ and is a
fast $f/4$,  especially good for large nebula, comets, or surveys.  A 14-inch
(0.36 meter) Celestron  telescope can be equipped with a fast camera for
planetary imaging.  A 27-inch (0.7 meter)  corrected Dall-Kirkham is scheduled
to be be delivered to Australia this fall, although we are unsure of the actual
date it could see light yet.
