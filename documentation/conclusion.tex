\section{Conclusion}

The VisLang compiler was moderately a success because it lays the groundwork for future
iterations of the program for use in a fully optimized environment as a replacement for
developing embedded programs using proprietary IDEs or programming languages that are
more difficult to understand. A variety of lessons where learned during the development
of the program that will be detailed below.

\subsection{Lessons Learned}
% don't be too ambitious
% test early, test often
% get the barest possible program working first

\subsection{Future Improvements}
% support for arrays
% support for structures
% additional parts
% built-in support for avr/arduino top level code generation
% support for updating sample time parameter
% graphical programming environment
