The architecture for vislang is as follows:
xml syntax -> xml scanning -> xml parsing -> xml syntax tree 
  -> blockification -> block object tree 
  -> runtime -> bytecode 
  -> compilation

the xml syntax tree is the literal representation of the incoming xml syntax
the block object tree is the literal translation of the block objects
bytecode is the translation of the BOT through the runtime into a stack-based representation of the program
compilation produces a valid c program from bytecode
