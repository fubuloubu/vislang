\section{Introduction}

VisLang is a block diagram language designed to allow fast and
easy prototyping of programs for embedded processors. The language is created
with a graphical editor in mind, and the core language is designed to be extensible
so that any graphical editor can add additional elements or attributes for graphical
display or other features.

\subsection{Key Language Features}

The language itself is based on the idea of blocks: small parts that can be grouped
together into ever larger blocks and re-used across different programs. VisLang has a
small group of fundamental (or atomic) blocks that will be understood by the VisLang
compiler. Other blocks will be constructed as groupings of these atomic blocks, and can
be referenced in other files. Libraries of useful function blocks can be constructed
from these atomic blocks containing common parts such as timers, latches, etc. The 
ability to include libraries and other blocks is a standard feature of the language.

The syntax of VisLang leverages standard XML, giving the language a well-formed and 
machine readable backbone. As noted previously, the point of leveraging XML is so that
3rd party programs can manipulate the file format in an easy way, and so that external
programs can add additional elements (e.g. visual information for display) and attributes
(e.g. location information) to the existing set of elements and attributes defined by
the language. Those tags (including XML comment tags) not included in the list of
recognized elements/attributes will be ignored by the compiler as a valid program is only
defined as a series of well-connected blocks. All parts require their necessary
attributes, and all connections require the source to exist. This creates a natural
flow to interpreting the language, such that any errors should be raised by the compiler
during compilation.

\subsection{Code Generation}

The VisLang Compiler will parse all of the parts specified in the input file and generate
a C source file that can be used in combination with other generated and manually created
C source files to generate fully functional programs for embedded devices. Each generated
file contains code that is completely reusable as the code generated has standard interfaces
and does not rely on global definitions.
