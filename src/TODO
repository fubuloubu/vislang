reorganize scanner to match the extra comment types (<? ?>, <![ ]>, and <!-- -->)
handle connections separetely
blocks can have inner elements, ignore inner elemenets for other parts (except connections)
parser should first hand parse through blocks and parts into the object specification syntax
the object specification syntax should be a struct definition the main compiler can use to interpret each type of part, and additionally ensure connections are valid (right name and type)
each part needs a functional component and a code generation equivalent. recursive parts (gates and sum/prod blocks) needs special attention. DT block needs a method for getting run time of the program.
